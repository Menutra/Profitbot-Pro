** JCE dev-fees ***

Devfees are:
  3.0% when using at least one CPU mining thread with non-AES architecture
  3.0% when using 32-bits version
  1.5% when using only 64-bits AES CPU architecture
  0.9% when using GPUs
 80.0% when using the --donate parameter
 
If both GPUs and CPUs are used, fees are averaged between devices.

And no fees are taken during the first minute,
in case you want to do a fee-free test.
