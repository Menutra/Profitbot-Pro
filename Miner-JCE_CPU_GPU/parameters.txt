-o ADDRESS:PORT      The pool address in the form ADDRESS:PORT, for example
                     xmrpool.eu:3333
                     It can be prefixed by:
                       stratum+tcp://
                       tcp://
                       stratum+ssl://
                       ssl://
                     In the two later cases, SSL will be automatically enabled.
                     The address can be a numeric dotted address like 51.144.104.161

-u WALLET            The wallet, or login with some large pools like MiningPoolHub or Nicehash.
                     If it's recognized, that's enough. If it's unrecognized or recognized as a different coin
                     add the parameters --any and --variation, see below.

-p PASSWORD          The password, on most pool it's used as a Worked ID for your miner.
                     If you don't know what to set, use "x".

--auto or -c CONFIG  --auto sets an optimized configuration based on your CPU, its cache and the coin you mine,
                     and on your GPUs, based on their memory.
                     -c CONFIG allows a manual fine tuning, with CONFIG being the path to the config file.

--low                Mine with low priority not to freeze your computer. Has a very small impact on performances.
                     Recommended.

--legacy             Use an alternate GPU handling mode that can solve hashrate speed regression, or increase that
                     speed in some card/algos combinations.
                     It also lowers the CPU usage when mining only on GPUs.

--ssl                Connect with SSL. Automatically enabled when your pool address is like ssl://......

--forever            Never give-up trying to connect, usefull when you have a weak Internet connection.
                     Recommended.

--nicehash           Use the Nicehash-specific Nonce type. Automatically enabled when your pool is Nicehash.
                     Not recommended, unless your pool requires it.

--elevate            Run as admin. Often required on Windows 7 and 8[.1] and Home Editions to have the Large Pages
                     working. Not available on Linux.
                     Not recommended, unless you need it.

-t N                 Hint the autoconfig to use N threads. N must not be greater than your number of CPUs.
                     Not recommended, expect to do some quick tests. Better fine-tune with parameter -c

-g Y,X,Z...          Forbid configuration (auto or manual) to use any GPU not in the list.
                     Comma separated list of GPU indexes (starting from 0).

--log LOGFILE        Also output log to a file.
                     Not recommended, except for diagnostics.

--archi ARCHI        Hint the autoconfig to use code optimized for a specific CPU architecture. The list of valid values
                     is at the end of the config.example.txt file.

************************
*** Minor parameters ***
************************

--retrydelay N       Delay, in seconds, between two connection attemps.

--autoclose N        Automatically quit after N minutes.
                     Useful when using a script to change pool and/or currency from time to time.

--keepalive          Ping the pool when no message has been sent for a long time.

--mport <PORT>       Json HTTP monitoring port and managment port (default=disabled).

--stakjson           Output Json HTTP in XMR-Stak format when --mport is used. Ignored otherwise.

-q                   Quit at first network problem. This is the opposite of --forever

--bus-order          Order GPUs by bus-id (default is OpenCL order).

--watchdog           Quit if a GPU gets stuck.

--watchdog N         Quit if a GPU gets stuck or the total GPU hashrate (ignoring CPUs) drops
                     under N h/s.

--max-temp M         Quit if a GPU raises above M degrees Celcius. Only for AMD GPUs.
