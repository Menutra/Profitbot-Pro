Supports Nicehash & SSL/TLS encrypted connections

Recommended drivers: Adrenalin 18.5.1, Adrenalin 18.5.2, Adrenalin 18.6.1



DevFee:
- DevFee is very low, it's only ~ 0.85% (both in normal mode and in algo switching mode)
- Using the same algo as user for devfee mining, so there is no difference in algo settings, power usage, etc..


Extra:
- Watchdog that monitors your GPU threads, if they stop hashing for a few minutes, miner restarts itself
- Hash monitor, if 5 minute average hash falls under the value you define, miner restarts itself
- Startup monitor, if miner can't init GPU's and start mining in a defined time, restarts itself or runs a user defined script
- Monitoring of GPU temperature, and if a critical temperature is reached, that particular GPU is turned off until it cools
- Set system shutdown temperature, to protect your GPU's from overheating
- Restart (disable/enable) Vega gpu's with before mining starts
- API for rig monitoring
- Set compute mode and disable crossfire on all AMD cards with one command
- Benchmark every algo locally without connecting to a pool

CONFIG.TXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can use these options :
Note: use all lowercase characters

"cryptonight_type" : "normalv8, normalv7, normal, lite, litev7, heavy, bittubev2, artocash, alloy, marketcash, b2n, stellitev4, haven, fast, italo, mox, dark, festival, freehaven"
"intensity" : 0-800, if set to 0 miner will try to find best settings for every video card
"worksize" : 1-256, if set, every video card will use this worksize, if not set, using auto detected value
"fragments" : 0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 or 9999. It can boost your hashrate if you find the right value for your GPU. 9999 is for the 'old' (v.1.6.8) type.
"heavy_mode" : 1,2 or 3. Method for doing calculations on heavy algos (Heavy, Haven, Swap, Italo, BitTube). Default is 1. 3 is experimental and the fastest, but most unstable.
"double_threads" : true or false, set it to true for best performance
"giveup_limit" : number, how many times to try connecting to a pool before switching to next pool from pools.txt. If set to 0 miner will quit and won't retry connecting.
"timeout" : number - seconds, when is a connection to a pool treated as time out
"retry_time" : number - seconds, how much to wait before trying to reconnect to a pool
"reboot_script_gpu_watchdog" : filename to a batch file in miner directory, if set it turns off built in miner reset procedure on gpu failure, and instead runs this script
"reboot_script_min_rig_speed" : filename to a batch file in miner directory, if set it turns off built in miner reset procedure on min_rig_speed trigger, and instead runs this script
"main_pool_reconnect" : number - seconds (minimum is 3 minutes or 180 sec), how often to try to reconnect back to the main pool. Default is 10 minutes.
"min_rig_speed" : number - in H/S, it defines the minimum rig hashing speed we want to maintain. If 5 minute average hashing speed is less than this, miner restarts.
"min_rig_speed_duration" : number - in seconds (minimum is 30 sec), defines the time period for average hashing speed calculation, used with 'min_rig_speed' parameter
"target_temperature" : number between 0-99, miner will try to maintain this temperature on all found video cards (ADL must be enabled, works only on cards supporting OverdriveN)
"shutdown_temperature" : number between 0-100, if this temperature is reached, miner will shutdown system (ADL must be enabled)



=================================
Manual GPU setup (advanced)
=================================

To manually set up video cards, you must create a "gpu_conf" array in the config.txt file.

Example :

"gpu_conf" : 
[ 
	{ "id" : 0, "intensity" : 0 , "worksize" : 16, "threads" : 2},
	{ "id" : 1, "intensity" : 0 , "worksize" : 16, "threads" : 2},
	{ "id" : 2, "intensity" : 60, "worksize" : 8 , "threads" : 2},
	{ "id" : 3, "intensity" : 55, "worksize" : 8 , "threads" : 2}
]


Additional parameters: 

"fragments" : 0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64 or 128. It can boost your hashrate if you find the right value for your GPU
"heavy_mode" : 1,2 or 3. Method for doing calculations on heavy algos (Heavy, Haven, FreeHaven, Italo, BitTube). Default is 1.
"off_temperature" : temperature in C, when to turn off GPU if it reaches this value. After value - 15, the GPU is turned on again automatically (default off is 85c, so turns it back when 70c)
"target_temperature" : 0-99, if set miner will try to maintain this temperature for this particular video card. If option 'target_temperature' on top of config.txt is set, this option WILL BE IGNORED. (ADL must be enabled, works only on cards supporting OverdriveN)
"target_fan_speed" : 0-6000, if set miner will try to set the video card fan speed to this speed. Setting is in RPM (rounds per minute) (ADL must be enabled)
"adl_type" : 1 or 2 , 1 - USE OVERDRIVEN , 2 - USE OVERDRIVE 5. Default is 1 if not set. Option 2 (Overdrive 5) is suitable for older cards
"persistent_memory" : true or false, if set miner will try to allocate extra memory for the video card, if it is available. CAUTION, MINER CAN BECOME UNSTABLE AND CRASH if using this option
"old_mode" : true or false, create kernels with the old method, useful probably only on Vegas with algos that have a scratchpad <= 1MB (default is false)




--------------------------------------------------------------------------
POOLS.TXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Example:

{
"pools" :
[
	{"pool" : "pool_1_address", "wallet" : "pool_1_wallet", "password" : "x"},
	{"pool" : "pool_2_address", "wallet" : "pool_2_wallet", "password" : "x"},
	{"pool" : "pool_3_address", "wallet" : "pool_3_wallet", "password" : "x"}
]
}

Pool on first position is the MAIN pool, others are counted as FAILOVER pools.

Additional parameters:

"worker" : worker name, not every pool supports this
"nicehash" : true or false, set this to true if you are using Nicehash
"keepalive" : true or false, not every pool supports this
"pool_use_tls": true or false, if true miner will use SSL/TLS to connect to pool
"job_timeout" : number in seconds, if no job is received for this period, miner will reconnect to the pool (Default is 20 minutes)
"max_difficulty" : number, if pool difficulty is above this value miner will reconnect to the pool
"cryptonight_type" : if defined, and --usealgoswitching is used, it indicates the algo for the pool.

A short explanation of "cryptonight_type" and how to use it :

{
"pools" :
[
	{"pool" : "pool_1_address", "wallet" : "pool_1_wallet", "password" : "x", "cryptonight_type" : "haven"},
	{"pool" : "pool_2_address", "wallet" : "pool_2_wallet", "password" : "x", "cryptonight_type" : "normalv8"},
	{"pool" : "pool_3_address", "wallet" : "pool_3_wallet", "password" : "x", "cryptonight_type" : "heavy"},
	{"pool" : "pool_4_address", "wallet" : "pool_4_wallet", "password" : "x", "cryptonight_type" : "fast"}
]
}

Set the algo used on the pool with the "cryptonight_type" parameter.
Set the --usealgoswitching parameter in start.bat

If needed, miner will re-init with the pool algo before switching to the pool.
For example if you are mining on pool_1 using haven algo, and you manually switch to the next pool, miner will re-init with normalv8 algo
before connecting to pool_2. Also if there are connection errors to pool_1, and miner automatically switches to the next pool, if the algos
of pools aren't the same, miner will re-init with the defined cryptonight_type for pool_2.

IMPORTANT: 
Do not set 'cryptonight_type' parameter for pools if you are using a proxy for coin switching, or a pool with algo switching capabilities! (example Monero Ocean)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When setting any of the parameters, don't use " or ' around the value!


To setup your video cards in cmd line :

These settings override the settings in config.txt
If you want to set everything in cmd line, you still need to have an empty config.txt file (which contains just : {}, or any other parameter like api etc etc )
First list devices (--listdevices or --listdevicesreordered if you are going to use --gpureorder), then you know the GPU id's and can set them up easy.

Parameters:

--ccryptonighttype value (algo to use)
--cgpuid value (gpu id, comma separated values, use --listdevices to see available)
--cgpuintensity value (gpu intensity, comma separated values)
--cgputhreads value (number of gpu threads, comma separated values)

--ckeepalive value (true or false, not every pool supports this)


Ex. for GPU and POOL setup from CMD:

Use 1 GPU with id 0 , intensity 120, 2 threads on algo cryptonight v7 on nanopool:
SRBMiner-CN.exe --ccryptonighttype normalv8 --cgpuid 0 --cgpuintensity 120 --cgputhreads 2 --cpool xmr-eu1.nanopool.org:14444 --cwallet 4A5hJyu2FvuM2azexYssHW2odrNCNWVqLLmzCowrA57xGJLNufXfzVgcMpAy3YWpzZSAPALhVH4Ed7xo6RZYyw2bUtbm12g.donation


Use 5 GPUS with id 0,1,2,3,4 , intensities 56,56,55,58,55, 2 threads for each GPU, on algo cryptonight v7 on nanopool:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALGO SWITCHING MODE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 2 types of algo switching supported :

Proxy or pool controlled 

This means the mining pool or proxy (software between your miner and the pool) decides what algo should be mined.
For example Monero Ocean pools support auto algo switching based on profitability. You can read everything about it on their FAQ page.

You can also use software which allows you to change the mining algorithm with a simple mouse click. One example is Hesido's Cryptonote Proxy tool.


Manually controlled 

In this mode the user sets the algorithm (cryptonight_type) for every pool he has in pools.txt.
When manually changing pools (by pressing 'o' or 'p'), miner will automatically re-init with the algo he set in pools.txt for that particular pool.
This also means you can set failover pools using any of the supported algorithms.


To use the algo switching mode (--usealgoswitching parameter in .bat) with pool controlled method the pool must support the XMRig Proxy Stratum protocol extensions(https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig-proxy/blob/master/doc/STRATUM_EXT.md)


Steps that are common for both switching types: 

1.] You can edit the file 'algos.txt', which contains entries for every algo you want the pool to send you jobs for (if using pool controlled switching). 
If you are using the manually controlled algo switching, setting up this file is important because of the various configurations that every algo has. 
The 'hashrate' parameter in this case isn't used.

You need to edit the 'hashrate' value if using pool controlled switching, and 'startup_script' if you are going to use it. (you can read what it is for under this text)
Also if you want, you can fully customize configs for every algo. You can find them in the 'Config' folder.


Short explanation of parameters in algos.txt:

+ "config" expects a filename to a config file where you set up everything for a specific algo (config-normalv8.txt is for CNV8 as you can guess).
So on every new algo switch SRBMiner will initialize settings specific for that algo.

+ "hashrate" is a parameter where you should write the total hashrate of your rig (in H/S) for that specific algo (you can easily find it out by running a benchmark for example).
This field is used by the pool in calculating what is the most profitable algo for you to mine.

+ "startup_script" can be used to run a script (batch file) before miner starts.
You can for example set clocks, voltages, etc. specific to that algo

You can easily benchmark the hashrates by running benchmark-algos.bat or by typing this into a command prompt:
SRBMiner-CN.exe --benchmarkalgos

This process will take a few minutes, and when finished it will create a file benchmark_results.txt with the hashrate for every algo you benchmarked.
Now you need to take and copy-paste those values into algos.txt under the right algorithm section.
The benchmarking procedure should be used only if using pool controlled algo switching. 


2.] There is a 'pools-algoswitch.txt' file where i predefined a few pools on Monero Ocean (algo switching pool), where i put my donation address as an example wallet,
so you should change this wallett address to your own.

If you are using the manually controlled pool switching, then you would define your own pools here.
You just need to add one new parameter (cryptonight_type) to each pool entry.

Here is an example how 'pools-algoswitch.txt' could look like:

{
"pools" :
[
{"pool" : "pool_1_address", "wallet" : "pool_1_wallet", "password" : "x", "cryptonight_type" : "haven"},
{"pool" : "pool_2_address", "wallet" : "pool_2_wallet", "password" : "x", "cryptonight_type" : "normalv8"},
{"pool" : "pool_3_address", "wallet" : "pool_3_wallet", "password" : "x", "cryptonight_type" : "heavy"},
{"pool" : "pool_4_address", "wallet" : "pool_4_wallet", "password" : "x", "cryptonight_type" : "fast"}
]
}

Now that you have algos.txt and pools-algoswitch.txt set up, start the miner by running start-algo-switching.bat

If you are using the pool controlled algo switching, DON'T set cryptonight_type for that pool, because you could get into an endless loop of algo switching :)

TIPS:
There are two algo switching modes available : with or without miner restart.

The 'miner restart' mode is recommended for Vega video cards, because they tend to drop mining speed on algo switching sometimes.
Using the 'miner restart mode' with the --resetvega parameter you are ensuring always maximum mining speeds.

Example:

SRBMiner-CN.exe --config Config\config-normalv8.txt --pools pools-algoswitch.txt --usealgoswitching --resetmineronalgoswitch --resetvega
