Privacy and Security
====================

Q. Is it a virus?
No. There's no malicious code at all, but since the source code is closed, I cannot prove it. The best I can do is to give a complete list of what the program does and doesn't.

Q. So, what does it do or not?
It does:

* Read the configuration file, if asked to (parameter -c)
* Scan your CPU and cache to autoconfigure and/or check the manual configuration
* Connect to pools on Internet to mine
* Write the log, if asked to (parameter --log)
* Try to autoconfigure the Huge Pages privileges if they're not working at first. That's the only intrusive action, but when it does it, it says so.
* Start a local HTTP server to get monitored, if asked to (default: disabled)

It doesn't:

* Write anything to your computer, except its own log, when enabled (default is disabled)
* Send any information, to me nor anywhere else
* Identify your computer or miner instance, not even using a hash
* Punch through your firewall: you have to open it manually if needed
* Run any command, not even attrib (see below)

Q. I see the JCE process punching the attrib command, what is it doing?
JCE does never run attrib, nor any other command, but it disguises its mining process into a attrib to avoid being detected and erased by antiviruses. Again, JCE does nothing malicious, but like all other miners it's detected as a virus so I've to do such a trick. That's the normal behavior of the 64-bits version. I never had the 32-bits detected, so I don't use that trick with it.

Q. Why is the binary so big?
Because it includes all combinations of implementations for all CPUs, all variations, and all Multi-hashes. And with or without Dual-Thread. And with or without Cache. That's literally hundreds of assembly codes.
In a lesser extent, it's a standalone executable with the HTTP micro server and SSL support embedded, which makes it still bigger.
