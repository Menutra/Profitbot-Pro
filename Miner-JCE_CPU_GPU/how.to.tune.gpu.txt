The GPU auto-configuration obtained with --auto is a safe but often sub-optimal configuration.
To get the maximum hashrate from your GPUs, better use the manual configuration:

1) Remove any parameter --auto from your command.
2) Add parameter -c config.txt
3) Edit the example config.txt file to fine-tune your GPUs.
4) If you also mine with CPUs, don't forget to configure your CPU threads.
   Otherwise leave the "cpu_threads_conf" array empty.
